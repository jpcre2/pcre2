PCRE2 is a re-working of the original PCRE library to provide an entirely new
API. The latest release of PCRE2 is always available in three alternative
formats from:

  ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre2-xxx.tar.gz

There is a mailing list for discussion about the development of PCRE (both the
original and new APIs) at pcre-dev@exim.org. You can access the archives and
